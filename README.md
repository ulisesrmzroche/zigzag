ZigZag is like Oblique Strategies. It gives you a card and an animation
meant to help you out when you get stuck. it's different because the cards are
meant for use in software development context, and specifically, the act of
writing code. And it's got an homage to DnD.

## Installation

`apm install zigzag`

## Rules of the Game

1. Shuffle ZigZaw Cards
2. Draw 20 cards without looking. These are your Zigzags.
3. Whenever you get stuck, roll a d20. Pull the card from your hand. Ask the
4. question like it was a magic 8 ball. Say it outloud.
5. Read the card. Ponder on it. Try to solve the problem again. Discard it.
5. Draw again if needed. But you only have 20 cards! After that, no more zig-zags!

when you feel like it. When you get stuck, burnt-out, or also just for fun.
