# ZigZag

ZigZag is like Oblique Strategies. It gives you a card and an animation
meant to help you out when you get stuck.


## Rules of the Game

1. Shuffle ZigZaw Cards
2. Draw 20 cards without looking. These are your Zigzags.
3. Whenever you get stuck, roll a d20. Pull the card from your hand.
4. Read the card. Ponder on it. Try to solve the problem again. Discard it.
5. Draw again if needed. But you only have 20 cards! After that, no more zig-zags!
